## Abstract

Deep Learning has become state of the art in visual computing and continuously emerges into the Music Information Retrieval (MIR) and audio retrieval domain. To bring attention to this topic we provide an introductory tutorial on deep learning for MIR. Besides a general introduction to neural networks, the tutorial covers a wide range of MIR relevant deep learning approaches. Convolutional Neural Networks are currently a de-facto standard for deep learning based audio retrieval. Recurrent Neural Networks have proven to be effective in onset detection tasks such as beat or audio-event detection. Siamese Networks have shown to be effective in learning audio representations and distance functions specific for music similarity retrieval. We introduce these different neural network layer types and architectures on the basis of standard MIR tasks such as music classification, similarity estimation and onset detection. We will incorporate both academic and industrial points of view into the tutorial. The tutorial will be accompanied by a Github repository for the presented content as well as references to state of the art work and literature for further reading. This repository will remain public after the conference.

## Tutorial Requirements

For the tutorials, we use iPython / Jupyter notebook, which allows to program and execute Python code interactively in the browser.

### Viewing Only

If you do not want to install anything, you can simply view the tutorials' content in your browser, by clicking on the tutorial's filenames listed above in the GIT file listing.

The tutorials will open in your browser for viewing.

### Interactive Coding

If you want to follow the tutorials by actually executing the code on your computer, please [install first the pre-requisites](#installation-of-pre-requisites) as described below.

After that, to run the tutorials go into the `ismir2018_tutorial` folder and start from the command line:

`jupyter notebook`

### Interactive Audio Listening examples within the Browser

The browser-based Jupyter notebooks contain HTML5 audio components to directly listen to predicted results such as for the task of music similarity retrieval. Almost all recent Internet Browsers prohibit direct file access due to decent security issues. Thus, the files have to be provided via the correct protocoll.

To enable the audio samples within the browser, [download](https://owncloud.tuwien.ac.at/index.php/s/bxY87m3k4oMaoFl) and extract the audio files to a directory on your computer. Open a Python Terminal and change to the `mp3_full` directory. Then host a simple Web-server with the following command:

`python -m http.server 9999 --bind 127.0.0.1`

This will server the directory via HTTP. The supplied parameters localhost and port-number are used equally in the Jupyter notebooks.



## Download Prepared Datasets

Please download the following data sets for this tutorial:

**MagnaTagAtune**

Prepared Features and Metadata: 

* [Part 1 & 2 Melspectograms (subset)](https://owncloud.tuwien.ac.at/index.php/s/vTO0vD6L1iGGpul) (96MB)
* [Extracted Rhythm Patterns Features](https://owncloud.tuwien.ac.at/index.php/s/YhVAqv81QYNHh8H) (23MB)
* [Audio-files](https://owncloud.tuwien.ac.at/index.php/s/DalHuoMuaxmmyzo) (220MB)

These are prepared versions from the original datasets described below.



## Installation of Pre-requisites

### Install Python 3.x

Note: On most Mac and Linux systems Python is already pre-installed. Check with `python --version` on the command line whether you have Python 3.x installed.

Otherwise install Python 3.5 from https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-350/

We recommend to install the Anaconda Python Distribution due to coverage of scientific Python libraries (most of the libs required in this tutorial are already included): https://www.anaconda.com/download/



## Install Python libraries:

### Mac, Linux or Windows

(on Windows leave out `sudo`)

Important note: If you have Python 2.x and 3.x installed in parallel, replace `pip` by `pip3` in the following commands:

```
sudo pip install --upgrade jupyter
```

Try if you can open 
```
jupyter notebook
```
on the command line. 

Then download or clone the Tutorials from this GIT repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/slychief/ismir2018_tutorial.git
```
or download https://github.com/slychief/ismir2018_tutorial/archive/master.zip <br/>
unzip it and rename the folder to `ismir2018_tutorial`.

Install the remaining Python libraries needed:

Either by:

```
sudo pip install Keras tensorflow scikit-learn pandas numpy librosa matplotlib progressbar2 seaborn scipy
```

or, if you downloaded or cloned this repository, by:

```
cd ismir2018_tutorial
sudo pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Optional for GPU computation

If you want to train your neural networks on your GPU (which is faster, but not necessarily needed for this tutorial),
you have to install the specific GPU version of Tensorflow:

```
sudo pip install tensorflow-gpu
```

and also install the following:

* [NVidia drivers](http://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx?lang=en-us)
* [CUDA](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads)
* [cuDNN](https://developer.nvidia.com/cudnn) (requires registration with Nvidia)


### Install Audio Decoder

In order to decode MP3 files (used in the MagnaTagAtune data set) you will need to install FFMpeg on your system.

* Linux: `sudo apt-get install ffmpeg`
* Mac: download FFMPeg for Mac: http://ffmpegmac.net and make sure ffmpeg is on PATH
* Windows: download https://github.com/tuwien-musicir/rp_extract/blob/master/bin/external/win/ffmpeg.exe and make sure it is on the PATH
